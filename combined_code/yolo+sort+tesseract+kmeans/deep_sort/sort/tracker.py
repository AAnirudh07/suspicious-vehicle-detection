        Maximum number of missed misses before a track is deleted.

    Attributes
    ----------
    metric : nn_matching.NearestNeighborDistanceMetric
        The distance metric used for measurement to track association.
    max_age : int

    n_init : int
        Number of frames that a track remains in initialization phase.

        A Kalman filter to filter target trajectories in image space.
